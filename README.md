This is a simple console based application similar to games like text twister, word link etc.


## How to Use:

### Rules:
1. The words which are important for GRE are classified into 5 levels.
2. You'll get the word and it's short meaning.
3. For detailed information, you can go to the url specified in the output.
4. You'll be given jumbled letters and you must find all the possible words that can be formed from the letters.
5. This code only emphasizes on the GRE words so the basic dictionary words are ignored.

## ToDo:

2. Develop it into a Android App or Web App.
